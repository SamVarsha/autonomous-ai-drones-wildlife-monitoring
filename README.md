# 🛰️ Autonomous AI Drones for Wildlife Monitoring (AirSim Simulation)

This project showcases a simulation-based system where autonomous drones, equipped with AI-powered vision, are deployed to detect and monitor wildlife in real time using Microsoft's AirSim environment. Designed to aid wildlife conservation, the system detects animal movement and logs visual data for further analysis.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 🐾 Animal detection using YOLOv8
- 🛩️ Autonomous drone flight using AirSim API
- 📹 Simulation built with Unreal Engine (Forest Environment)
- 🧠 Real-time logging and data capture of wildlife sightings

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- AirSim (Simulation)
- Unreal Engine (Forest Scene)
- Python 3.11+
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
